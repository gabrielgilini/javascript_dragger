This is some generic drag code, it started as something simple I needed, then turned into something I'd like to improve continuously.
Lots of this code was made with stuff that I learned at the comp.lang.javascript FAQ <http://www.jibbering.com/faq/> and from the people at the newsgroup.
Any comments and critics will be greatly appreciated.

Just add the drag.js script to your page and call the drag.init() function when the page loads.
This function accepts two parameters:
    - elm
        An element reference or a string with the matching ID of the element to be dragged.
    - handler (optional)
        An element reference or a string with the matching ID of the element that will be the movement handler.
        If none is passed, the function will make the first element also be the handler.
